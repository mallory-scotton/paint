# üé® MyPaint - Digital Painting Application

A digital painting application built with C and CSFML as part of the B-MUL-200 multimedia programming course at Epitech. This project demonstrates fundamental graphics programming concepts, user interface design, and drawing tool implementation.

## üìã Project Overview

MyPaint is a student project that recreates the basic functionality of a digital painting application. Built using C programming language and the CSFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), it showcases skills in graphics programming, event handling, and software architecture.

This first-year project implements core features like drawing tools, canvas management, and a graphical user interface, serving as an introduction to multimedia programming and game development concepts.
